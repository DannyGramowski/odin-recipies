    <h1>Chicken And Dumplings</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. 
        This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation 
        I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h5>½ tablespoon olive oil</h5>
        <h5>1 cup diced onion</h5>
        <h5>½ cup diced carrot</h5>
        <h5>½ cup diced celery</h5>
        <h5>1 bay leaf</h5>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>
            Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. 
            Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. 
            Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
            Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside. 
        </p>
    </ol>
